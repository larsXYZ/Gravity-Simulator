# Gravity-Simulator-v1.0-SOURCE

This is the source code for my gravity simulation project. I made it when first learning C++ / programming in university back in 2016.
The code was terrible and filled with poor solutions to simple problems. During Christmas 2025 I revisited it and replaced some of the old bad solutions with new bad solutions.

You can see a trailer I made in 2016 here:

# Creating a solution

Gravity-Simulator uses the graphics library [SFML 2.6.2](http://www.sfml-dev.org/)
and the user interface library [TGUI 1.6.1](https://www.tgui.eu/). It uses CMake for build management.

Built the solution with:

    cmake .
