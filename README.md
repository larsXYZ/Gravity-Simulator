# Gravity-Simulator-v1.0-SOURCE

This is the source code for my gravity simulation project. DISCLAIMER: Keep in
mind it started out as a simple test. So the code is horribly organized. I am
also Norwegian, so some stuff might be in Norwegian. I've tried to make it
easier to understand. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCslIyA4_1rciR3loFI09pZQ
